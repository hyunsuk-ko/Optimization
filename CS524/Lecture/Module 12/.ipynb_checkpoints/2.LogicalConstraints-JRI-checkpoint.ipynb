    "\n",
    "Production planning problems involve making decisions about how of several different products to make. Suppose Jedi Robes, Inc., top producer of robes for the Jedi Council, expands to producing 5 clothing items by using two different production processes: weaving and infusing. Each clothing item requires a number of hours to produce and contributes a fixed number of credits to JRIâ€™s profit. Each unit of each product requires 20 hours of labor for final assembly. The production factory has 3 weaving machines and 2 infusion tanks. The facility runs 6 days a week with 2 shifts each day (8 hours/shift). Eight employees work in assembly, each working one shift/day. Figure out how many items to produce each week.\n",
